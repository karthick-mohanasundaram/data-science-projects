Until now the record had been €18.7 billion in September 2007.', 'International criticism has mounted - especially from Washington - that Europe’s bulwark economy must do more to spur domestic demand and that its reliance on exports is hampering Europe’s economic stability and hurting the global economy.', '“The record surplus is likely to add fuel to the flames, but I don’t see a problem in them,” said Stefan Schilbe of HSBC Trinkaus, highlighting the differences of views on both sides of the Atlantic.', '“With a certain delay, German companies will increase their capacities, which will help our trade partners because more goods and services will be bought from there.”', 'The US administration reprimanded Germany in strong terms late last month in its semi-annual report to Congress for its economic imbalances. Germany’s current account surplus, at €19.7 billion in September, is the biggest in the world.', 'European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso used softer language in Frankfurt this week but his message was similar: Germany had “homework” to do on stability in the euro zone.', 'Conservative politicians in Germany, which has taken over the spotlight from China, were quick to reject the criticism though Chancellor Angela Merkel’s likely future coalition partner agreed more must be done to spur domestic demand.', 'Seasonally-adjusted exports gained a forecast-beating 1.7 per cent on the month, the Federal Statistics Office data showed, while imports, expected to rise 0.6 percent, fell 1.9 percent.', 'Exports rose to all trade partners but particularly to the European Union, which bought 5.4 per cent more goods and services from Germany.

Trade is expected to subtract from rather than contribute to economic growth in 2013, while domestic demand, albeit still weak, will drive Germany’s modest expansion. (Online News)', '.
