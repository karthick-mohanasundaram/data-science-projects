['Cabinet working on ‘most equitable’ budget possible', 'Kenny says health sector remains a priority', 'Taoiseach Enda Kenny at the launch of DCU’s new Centre for Family Business at the Helix,  Dublin, yesterday. Photograph: Brian Lawless/PA Wire', 'Taoiseach Enda Kenny has said Ministers are working on the “fairest and most equitable” budget possible.', 'Speaking on his way into today’s Cabinet pre-budget meeting, Mr Kenny said there was still a lot of work to do in advance of Tuesday’s announcements, with “some very tough decisions to be made” even while the forecast expenditure cuts had been reduced from €3.1 billion to €2.5 billion.', 'The Taoiseach did not comment directly on reports in this morning’s Online News that Minister for Social Protection Joan Burton was looking at cuts to secondary benefits for pensioners and the disabled such as for electricity and telephone allowances, but he said Ministers would “make the best decisions that they can”.', 'Minister for Finance Michael Noonan said the Government is finalising details in relation to the health budget in particular.', 'There is still a lack of clarity as to whether there will be a supplementary budget for the health service, which has cost overruns this year estimated at €150 million, or whether the overruns will have to be carried over into next year’s budget.', 'Mr Noonan said the goal of the budget will be to “maintain the health services and maybe expand them a little bit, but at the same time come under the expenditure ceilings that are required”.', 'Both Minister for Public Expenditure Brendan Howlin and Minister for Health Dr James Reilly and their officials are “working through various options” in relation to the health department, he revealed. There will be another Cabinet meeting on Sunday.', 'Mr Howlin said they had difficult decisions to make because they were returning to the same measures they had examined “again and again, year-on-year” for savings.', '“The choices are narrowing, but we are close down to a final settlement across all Government departments which is fair and reasonable. We have to go through it line-by-line with Cabinet colleagues today. Bit by bit the jigsaw is taking shape and we will be in good shape by Tuesday.”', '.
