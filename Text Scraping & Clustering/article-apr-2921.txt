['Organisation calls on Government to revise budget measures', 'INMO general secretary Liam Doran said frontline health services are under ’real strain’ due to lack of resources Photograph: Eric Luke/The Online News', 'The health service will become “wholly inadequate” following budget cuts of €666 million, the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation has warned.', 'The organisation this morning said patient care will be “severely compromised” following a sixth consecutive year of cutbacks. They also claimed the Government has refused to introduce adequate revenue raising, public health measures on tobacco products, alcohol and sugary drinks.', '“The inevitable outcome of these two contradictory strategies will be a wholly inadequate, and underfunded, health service unable to cope with the demands of a population,” the INMO said in a statement.', 'The organisation will discuss the budget measures at a special delegate conference in Croke Park tomorrow. Their criticism comes amid mounting pressure on Minister for Health James Reilly over the extent of the health service cutbacks.', 'The Online News reported on Saturday that the level of cuts could reach €1 billion if promised but unfunded developments were to be implemented while new figures to be published later this week will show that health services recorded a financial overrun of €71.987 million to the end of August.', 'The INMO said the budget cuts will see a further reduction in staffing numbers of 2,000 on top of a reduction of 10,000 over the past five years. Consequently, “safe care through safe practice will not be possible as we move through 2014”.', 'The organisation said increased levies on tobacco, beer, and sugary drinks could bring in some €180 million a year, generating “the necessary revenue to maintain our public health service”. But it suggested that “vested interested behind these industries” were obstructing proper health planning.', 'It added that a 1 per cent increase on the temporarily lowered VAT rate on restaurants and hotels would raise almost €100 million.', '“The health service in the frontline is now very efficient but under real strain due to lack of resources,” said INMO general secretary, Liam Doran . “It is not a ‘black hole’ and the government should not be swayed by others who, to protect their massive profits, resist any new/additional taxes or levies on their products even though they lead to cancer, obesity and anti-social behaviour.”', 'Mr Doran added that the INMO will seek alliances with other expert groups involved in public health and call on the Government to revise its policies in the area.', 'Separately, the National Association of General Practitioners has said doctors may not agree to operate a free scheme for children aged five and under.', '“We thought in good faith they were going to announce a scheme that was likely to deliver a high-end service,” the organisation’s chairman Dr Andrew Jordan told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland. “Unfortunately a figure of €37m was rolled out. Of course we realised this was just an extension of the present GMS which is not a top-end service.”', 'Return to results']
