It is also scheduled to be debated at a hearing of the Oireachtas health committee on Thursday.', 'The overall financial deficit is less than the worst-case scenario of €286 million which the HSE projected in correspondence to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform several weeks ago.', 'However, it is higher than the deficit for the year of about €150 million forecast by the Minister for Health James Reilly following the budget in October.', 'A HSE spokesman declined to confirm the figures for the financial deficit. However, the spokesman said the HSE’s financial out-turn for 2013 was “remarkably good considering certain matters that had arisen over the course of the year”.', 'Government policy issues', 'Over the last 12 months the HSE has had to deal with financial pressures generated from a number of issues, particularly Government policy issues, outside of its control.', 'This includes a Government decision not to seek €104 million in accelerated payments – essentially payments in advance – from the health insurance industry, as well as delays in introducing legislation to allow for greater scope to charge private patients treated in public hospitals.

A key element of the planned savings is a “probity” exercise in relation to medical cards which had a target of realising €113 million. In addition, a further €20 million in savings was sought in other parts of the budget for primary care services.', 'Service plan', 'The Online News reported at the end of November that', 'HSE director general Tony O’Brien had warned in a letter accompanying the service plan that the scale of cuts envisaged to spending on medical card services was being taken against the advice of both his organisation and the Department of Health.', 'The HSE service plan is being assessed by the Department of Health, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of the Taoiseach .', 'Comments are closed for this article.']
