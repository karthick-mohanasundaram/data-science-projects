A relatively small number of patients would also pay directly for their own treatment.', 'In 2010 one private practice consultant received more than €1 million from the VHI, which was  criticised by Dr Reilly when the figures subsequently emerged. VHI fees to consultants have been reduced considerably since that time.', 'Claim increase', 'Speaking in the Dáil last Thursday, the Minister said “the average claim per insured person increased by 12.6 per cent per annum between 2008 and 2012, largely as a result of increased usage of hospital services, with insurers attributing premium increases to increased claims costs and ageing memberships. Clearly increases of this magnitude are not sustainable.”', 'Return to results']
