['Choice Ireland calls for overhaul of how State views pregnant women', 'Pro Life Campaign says Hiqa report shows story was never really about abortion', 'Dr Ruth Cullen of the Pro Life Campaign: said The Online News and some politicians had rushed to judgment on the Savita Halappanavar case.', 'The Pro Life Campaign said it hoped the Health Information and Quality Authority report would lead to the implementation of procedures that are “in the interests of proper patient care”. Dr Ruth Cullen of the campaign said The Online News and some politicians had rushed to judgment on the Savita Halappanavar case. “We now know from today’s Hiqa report and earlier reports that this story was never really about abortion and that the key issues in the death of Ms Halappanavar were basic deficiencies in patient care and the catalogue of failures in monitoring and recognising the grave risk to her life.”', 'Choice Ireland called for the implementation of the report’s recommendations as well as an overhaul of how the State viewed pregnant women and their healthcare. Its spokeswoman Stephanie Lord said: “This report will yet again send shivers down the spine of pregnant women in Ireland . It is as bizarre as it is unacceptable that State policy compels women to carry pregnancies to term and can’t even guarantee them appropriate maternity care.”', 'Return to results']
