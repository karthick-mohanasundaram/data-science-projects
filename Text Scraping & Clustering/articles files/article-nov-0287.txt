['Patients and doctors would benefit from duty of candour obligation, conference hears', 'Mr Justice Liam McKechnie: said justice sysetme must provide all necessary support to anyone harmed as a result of a  medical mishap.  File  Photograph: Bryan O’Brien/The Online News', 'Patients, doctors and health managers would all benefit from the introduction of a system requiring healthcare professionals to disclose medical accidents promptly, a conference has heard.', 'There is a compelling case for creating a legal “duty of candour” for victims of medical negligence, according to speakers at the conference organised by two patient advocacy groups.', 'The current adversarial approach to medical accidents and complaints prolongs pain for families, as they are forced to battle with the system for compensation on behalf of their loved one, delegates were told. A more open system would see all healthcare professionals obliged to reveal when a medical accident takes place at the earliest possible opportunity, according to Peter Walsh , chief executive of Action against Medical Accidents.', '“Someone who goes into a hospital and through no fault of their own has their health compromised and their quality of life diminished.

However, since a similar system was introduced in Illinois, malpractice premium expenses had dropped by $22 million over three years and claims have fallen by up to 50 per cent.', '“Patients are less likely to sue when a hospital is forthcoming and transparent,” he said.
