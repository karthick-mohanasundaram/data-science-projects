Children who spend a lot of time in front of television, video games and small screens are more likely to become overweight.', 'The latest report from the Growing Up in Ireland research shows that five-year-old children who spend three or more hours in front of a screen are considerably more likely to consume unhealthy foods more often and become obese.', 'And don’t reassure yourself that this fat will melt away when they turn into teenagers.

But what if this doesn’t work? What if you’ve had your fill of the mooing cow on Minecraft? What if the constant whine of “it’s my go on the Xbox” gets too much?', 'Simply remove the fuse from the plug and blame a loose wire.
